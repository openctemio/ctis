// Package outcome is the per-target outcome of a scan task: how each of the
// task's targets ended. A sensor reports one outcome per target when a task
// ends (completed, partial or stopped part-way); the platform settles every
// target that has an outcome and hands only the unfinished ones out again,
// so a task that stopped after part of its work never runs the finished
// targets a second time.
//
// States:
//
//   - done: the target was scanned (whatever it found, nothing included);
//   - failed: the tool tried the target and it failed, with a class:
//     unreachable (no answer, no route, no name), timeout (the target's own
//     time budget ran out), tool_error (the tool failed on that target) or
//     egress_refused (the sensor's network confinement refused every
//     connection the tool made toward the target: it was not reached, and
//     nothing can be said about it);
//   - skipped: the target was not run on purpose, with a class: refused (a
//     policy refused it) or excluded (the job's exclusions cover it);
//   - unfinished: the task stopped before the target got an outcome.
//
// Revision 2 adds classes that tell why a target was not covered, so the
// platform does not read a fact about the target as a failure of the scan:
//
//   - name_gone: the name no longer exists (an authoritative NXDOMAIN or
//     NODATA answer);
//   - resolver_failed: the name could not be resolved (SERVFAIL, REFUSED, a
//     resolver timeout): ambiguous, it may be the sensor's own DNS;
//   - sensor_network_fault: the sensor's own network failed the control
//     probe, so nothing can be said about the target;
//   - rate_limited: the target asked the scan to slow down and the task
//     could not finish at the rate it allowed;
//   - edge_challenged and edge_blocked: an edge protection (a WAF or CDN)
//     answered with a challenge or a block in place of the service, so the
//     service was not scanned. Failed when the edge started answering during
//     the task, skipped when the task did not run the target because of it.
//
// A target also carries an optional cause side (target, sensor or platform),
// a short reason for an unreachable target (no_route, filtered, host_down,
// ...) and the edge vendor. They are additive: a receiver that does not know
// them ignores them, and Legacy gives the entry a receiver of revision 1
// accepts. A sensor sends revision 2 entries only to a platform that
// advertised them; an entry with a class the receiver does not know is never
// read as done.
//
// Done, failed and skipped settle a target: retrying it would give the same
// answer, so it is not handed out again in the same run. Unfinished is the
// only state that asks for another attempt.
//
// The platform never trusts a sensor's list as is. Normalize reads it
// against the task's own target list: a target the task does not carry is
// dropped (a sensor can never add work), an entry with an unknown state or
// class is ignored, and a task target with no valid entry is unfinished.
//
// The package is part of the CTIS contract (standard library only): the
// platform and the sensor SDK both import it, so neither depends on the
// other for this shape.
